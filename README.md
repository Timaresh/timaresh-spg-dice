This module works as an addon to Dice so Nice, adding a textured StartPlaying.Games themed dice for usage in FoundryVTT.

Future Plans
I definitely plan on adding more dice when inspiration strikes and I have the time.

Feedback
If you have any feedback, feel free to throw a dm in discord at me (bh3lliom). Doesn’t matter if it’s about requests, errors in the code or other dice related musings.
